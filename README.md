# Hiimdave's Lootfilters

## About
These are filters I've built for myself and/or my play group that are built on top of the Kyzard loot filter as a base.

## Using the Filters

### Option 1
1. Copy the content (text) from the filter of your choice and replace the default.filter contents (text) in your ProjectDiablo2 root folder and save the file.
2. Download the files from GitHub and copy the filter of your choice to your Project Diablo 2 root folder.  Delete your old default.filter file and rename this one to replace it.

### Option 2
1. Copy the content (text) from the filter of your choice and replace the default.filter contents (text) in your ProjectDiablo2 root folder => filters => local folder and save the file.
2. Download the files from GitHub and copy the filter of your choice to your Project Diablo 2 folder => filters => local folder.  If you have a default.filter there, delete it.  Rename this file to default.filter.

**Remember to always reload your filter after making any changes in game!!!**

#### Reloading your Filter
Numpad 0 or Ctrl + R unless you have changed the default bindings.

#### Common Issues
1. My launcher sits on Updating... forever! - You probably put the file into your local filters folder and didnt rename it to default.filter.  If it is not named exactly that, this occurs.

## Filters

### Categories
There are two main categories of filters:
1. Normal - These are the standard, strict, and super strict filters and are Kyzard's base filter with minimal adjustments.
2. Custom - These are the custom prefixed filters that are the normal filter, with added changes...generally not great for use unless you can read the filter code to know what's changed.
3. Frontliner - For your Charge Paladins to stay alive and focus...

### Strictness
* Standard - This is the basic filter for general play.  Good for fresh ladders and new players.
* Strict - Hides things that higher level (80-90+) characters probably won't care about, or you don't care to see in endgame farming.
* Super-Strict - Even more strictness applied.  Only use if you are hunting for the best of the best.
* Uber-Strict - Get the idea yet? Basically just shows Gems, Runes, Great Uniques/Sets, Jewels, Charms, Full Rejuvs, etc.

## Disclaimer
**Use at your own risk!** - All filters were created for my own and my team's use, and I don't promise ther will not be bugs, or that you may miss drops you personally may have wanted if you chose the wrong filter or were not aware of what it hid.
