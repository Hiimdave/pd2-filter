# Hiimdave's Lootfilters

## About
These are filters I've built for myself and/or my play group that are built on top of the Kyzard loot filter as a base.

## Filters

### Categories
There are two main categories of filters:
1. Normal - These are the standard, strict, and super strict filters and are Kyzard's base filter with minimal adjustments.
2. Custom - These are the custom prefixed filters that are the normal filter, with added changes...generally not great for use unless you can read the filter code to know what's changed.

### Strictness
* Standard - This is the basic filter for general play.  Good for fresh ladders and new players.
* Strict - Hides things that higher level (80-90+) characters probably won't care about, or you don't care to see in endgame farming.
* Super-Strict - Even more strictness applied.  Only use if you are hunting for the best of the best.

## Disclaimer
**Use at your own risk!** - All filters were created for my own and my team's use, and I don't promise ther will not be bugs, or that you may miss drops you personally may have wanted if you chose the wrong filter or were not aware of what it hid.
