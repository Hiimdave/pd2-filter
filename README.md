# Hiimdave's Lootfilters

## About
These are filters I've built for myself and/or my play group that are built on top of the Kyzard loot filter as a base.

## Using the Filters

### Option 1
1. Copy the content (text) from the filter of your choice and replace the default.filter contents (text) in your ProjectDiablo2 root folder and save the file.
2. Download the files from GitHub and copy the filter of your choice to your Project Diablo 2 root folder.  Delete your old default.filter file and rename this one to replace it.

### Option 2
1. Copy the content (text) from the filter of your choice and replace the default.filter contents (text) in your ProjectDiablo2 root folder => filters => local folder and save the file.
2. Download the files from GitHub and copy the filter of your choice to your Project Diablo 2 folder => filters => local folder.  If you have a default.filter there, delete it.  Rename this file to default.filter.

**Remember to always reload your filter after making any changes in game!!!**

#### Reloading your Filter
Numpad 0 or Ctrl + R unless you have changed the default bindings.

## Filters

### Categories
There are two main categories of filters:
1. Normal - These are the standard, strict, and super strict filters and are Kyzard's base filter with minimal adjustments.
2. Custom - These are the custom prefixed filters that are the normal filter, with added changes...generally not great for use unless you can read the filter code to know what's changed.
3. Frontliner - For your Charge Paladins to stay alive and focus...

### Strictness
* Standard - This is the basic filter for general play.  Good for fresh ladders and new players.
* Strict - Hides things that higher level (80-90+) characters probably won't care about, or you don't care to see in endgame farming.
* Super-Strict - Even more strictness applied.  Only use if you are hunting for the best of the best.
* Uber-Strict - Get the idea yet? Basically just shows Gems, Runes, Great Uniques/Sets, Jewels, Charms, Full Rejuvs, etc.

## Common Issues and Bug Reports
1. My launcher sits on Updating... forever! - You probably put the file into your local filters folder and didnt rename it to default.filter.  If it is not named exactly that, this occurs.

2. I don't see XYZ - It could be something in Kyzard's base filter that is filtering out based on CLVL or it could be due to the strictness you chose.  When in doubt try the Standard filter and work your way up the strictness.

### How to submit a bug:
If you believe there is a bug with the filter, first try Kyzard's filter standalone to verify it is something with my custom overrides first.  Second, ensure you use appropriate options in game, I personally turn on everything other than Verbose Notifications.

If you can verify the issue, send a Discord PM to Hiimdave#2967 with the description of the issue, item it is for, filter you were using, and as much detail as possible.  If it is for specific bases/superior/magic/rare items try to include the item code and info on the item as well (eth, sock #, rarity, superior, exceptional, elite, etc) etc.

#### Good Bug Reports
These give enough info for me to try to test them out.  Try to make it easy for me to reproduce and verify.
> Example 1: I don't see Unique Shako's notifying using the Standard filter.
> Example 2: Quantity showing twice on Runes 1-9 using the Custom Standard filter.

#### Bad Bug Reports
These are super generic and don't give me any info to go on really.  Don't be these people...
> Example 1: Why don't I see some set items?
> Example 2: Does your filter hide XYZ?  I don't see it?


## Disclaimer
**Use at your own risk!** - All filters were created for my own and my team's use, and I don't promise ther will not be bugs, or that you may miss drops you personally may have wanted if you chose the wrong filter or were not aware of what it hid.
