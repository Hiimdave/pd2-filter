# Hiimdave's Lootfilters

## Using the Filters
Copy the content (text) from the filter (click the Raw button) and then, either:

1. Replace the contents of the default.filter file in your ProjectDiablo2 root folder with that copied text.
2. Replace the contents of the default.filter file in your ProjectDiablo2 root folder => filters => local folder with that copied text.

Now save the file, and once back in game press Numpad 0 or Ctrl + R or Ctrl + Shift + R depending on your bindings.

**Remember to always reload your filter after making any changes in game!!!**

## Filters

### Categories
There are two main categories of filters:
1. Normal - These are the standard, strict, and super strict filters and are Kyzard's base filter with minimal adjustments.
2. Custom - These are the custom prefixed filters that are the normal filter, with added changes...generally not great for use unless you can read the filter code to know what's changed.
3. Frontliner - For your Charge Paladins to stay alive and focus...

## Common Issues and Bug Reports
1. My launcher sits on Updating... forever! - You probably put the file into your local filters folder and didnt rename it to default.filter.  If it is not named exactly that, this occurs.

2. I don't see XYZ - It could be something in Kyzard's base filter that is filtering out based on CLVL or it could be due to the strictness you chose.  When in doubt try the Standard filter and work your way up the strictness.

## Disclaimer and Credits
The base of this filter is Kyzard's Lootfilter for PD2.

**Use at your own risk!** -  I don't promise there will not be bugs, or that you may miss drops you personally may have wanted if I hid or made it less obvious. There are no maliciously hidden items or drops.
